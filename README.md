## Understanding Tweenmax

Tweenmax allows to create easy animations and timelines. In this course, we will use a lot of timeline because they're easily modified.

Create a timeline :

```javascript
var tween = new TimelineMax()
```

Using a TimelineMax instance, we can access to all functionnalities and all easing functions. You can use TimelineLite if you want it to be lighter.
